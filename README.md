### 👨‍💻 About Me

I work at the intersection of **cybersecurity and automation**, building tools that reduce repetitive tasks and help analyze or secure systems.  
My background is hands-on — scripting, breaking, testing, and improving systems rather than just reading about them.

I'm especially interested in:

- Security automation & tooling development  
- Ethical hacking methodology & exploit analysis  
- Windows internals, Linux security, and host hardening  
- Scripting workflows using **Python, PowerShell & Bash**

My long-term goal is to build and contribute to tools used by **security engineers, red teams, and DFIR workflows.**
